Plan

First need to setup a way to fingerprint myself
  some kind of webserver on localhost that just has a homepage and fingerprintjs running on it
    Just use the stuff I know
      or better find one of my old projects and throw up the code, like the fullstack one


  setup and run fingerprintjs on the webserver

  visit it on chrome and see what i get




fingerprintjs
  says it wont work using an import if visitor is running firefox or a blocker

Web server is running
  Im getting a different fingerprint value on zen vs chromium

  why could this be?

    Different User agent
      check the outbound requests
    
    Maybe one of them is spoofing or blocking something
      check zen for this

    free one is meant to be much worse so it could just not be as good

Displaying the get request from each browser
  very different LMAO
  no wonder its not the same fingerprint

  turns out zen is built off of firefox not chrome, which is why the headers are as different as they are


What else I want to do
  Visit it in kali
    one with the same browser one with a different one
  find a way to display the fingerprint object and see the attributes rather than just the ID
  maybe get another chromium browser and see if it would fingerprint the same thing


I want to see if i can get the attributes that it finds rather than just the raw fingerprint result

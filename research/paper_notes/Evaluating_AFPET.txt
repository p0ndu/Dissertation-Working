This paper centres around evaluating different methods of fingerprint defence

How they measured each AFPET's effectiveness
  Method 1
    Focused around looking directly at an AFPETs ability to mask attributes

    Runs browsers with and without AFPET installed to determine which attributes are masked and how
    Have them visit a fingerprinting server
    Compare the fingerprints with and without each AFPET using an analasys engine (FPIinspector)

    Can be applied to AFPETS without a user base and without having its source code
    
  Method 2
    Context dependant and observational methods
    
    Sites like panopticlick and amiunique have large sets of real-world fingerprints, revealing which are the most trackable
    These datasets can be studied to evaluate an AFPET by checking how trackable fingerprints of their users are compared to the rest of the dataset

    In practice, the datasets dont say which fingerprint is using which AFPET
      hard to tell the effectiveness of each of them, especially on ones with small user numbers 

    Method 3
      combines the fingerprinting of method 1 (FPIinspector) with the analysis of method 2 (PETInspector)

      uses FPIinspector to create a 'mask model' of each AFPET and applies that mask to the real world fingerprint dataset to produce a dataset representing what the browsers would look like to trackers if everyone had used that specific AFPET
      By comparing the trackabilities on the two datasets (base and AFPET mask applied) you can measure the effectiveness of the AFPET
      

Entropy
  how unique/unpredictable a browser fingerprint is in a dataset
    higher entropy -> fingerprints are more unique -> easier to track
    lower entropy -> fingerprints are less unique -> harder to track

3 types of PETs
  Attribute standardising
    making your browser attributes appear as one of a small set of possible values
    full standardisation makes all AFPET users appear identical
    partial makes them appear from a few groups
    AFPET may choose partial over full if spoofing an attribute value has implications for the user

  Attribute varying
    vary the value of an attribute so that the values of each user vary accross browsing activities

  Attribute blocking
    block some/all interactions between the browsing platform and trackers
    can rely on a blacklist or block interactions matching known tracking patterns
    

Testing method
  Using PETInspector, we performed an initial experiment finding no
  additional spoofing from AFPETs crossing sessions. Thus, to save
  time, our main experiment uses only a single session and does not
  check for the masking of attributes by variation across sessions.
  We use ClientSim to simulate six browsing platforms. Three of
  these are virtual machines running various versions of Linux. We
  introduce additional changes into these virtual machines to sim-
  ulate differences in system configurations. Specifically, we install
  different fonts and browser versions, set up different timezones,
  and simulate different screen resolutions and languages, The re-
  maining platforms run natively on a Linux desktop, Macbook Pro,
  and a PC laptop. We perform measurements on Firefox and Chrome
  browsers. More details on these configurations are in Table 2.
  ClientSim drives these experimental browsing platforms to reach
  FPServer for five reloads of each of the two domain names of FPServer.
  On each platform, it performs these reloads a total of 28 times: one
  time each for 26 PETs and one time each for the two baseline
  browsers. All PETs are left in their default configurations.


Section 4.3 - Results
  Baseline browsers show no natural variation
  15 AFPETS tested
    12 mask at least one attribute in default settings
    3 show no detectable masking with default configs

    Some mask attributes they didnt claim and others behave inconsistently

  11 Non-AFPET tools
    BLPETs
    some modify attributes in ways that make users more identifyable
      inconsistent/illogical attributes

So TLDR
  many AFPETS do not properly hide you
  some make you more detectable due to inconsistent and illogical attributes 
    basically they contradict eachother meaning that you have spoofed it in some way

  most AFPETs mask one attribute and only a few mask many
  Tor browser bundle was the best effective method
  Many tools claim to mask attributes but behave inconsistently
  some non AFPET tools made you easier to track
    primarily the blacklist based ones

  Since the list of fingerprintable attributes is basically infinite, all results of this paper should be considered optimistic from the view of avoiding tracking

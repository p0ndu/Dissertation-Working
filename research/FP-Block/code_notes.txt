Code Notes
=========================
First what are these weird extensions
  .xul
    XML User Interface Language
      XML dialect for writing graphical user interfaces
  .rdf
    Resource Description Framework
      supposedly to exchange graphing data?
      data model for metadata
  .jsm
    Javascript Module

install.rdf
  Mostly sets metadata
    details about the plugin
    which firefox versions it supports

 #########################################################################################   
  FOR SOME REASON CHROME:// IN FIREFOX MEANS FIREFOX'S INTERNAL ui/RESOURCE SYSTEM
    what the fuck who named that why is that the name what bro thats a different browser
    what a stupid fucking name
 ##########################################################################################


Okay How does this shit actually work
  Firefox loads -> browser.xul loads -> chrome.manifest overlays are applied -> fpblock overlay.xul loads -> script tags inside overlay.xul run -> obververs and content scripts are registered


=================================
Starting with modules first
=================================

detection.jsm
  FP-Blocks internal records of fingerprinting attempts

  stores when a site tries to read a fingerprint-relevant attribute

httpRequestObserver.jsm
  Observes all request and if the topic is 'http-on-modify-request'
    it gets the http channel of the request
      HTTP channel is basically just the tcp connection that the data is flowing through
    tries to get the domain of the request
    tries to get the identity corresponding to the domain
      if none exists then it tries to make one
    Sets all the browser data to that of the identity
      this code block seems to contain cases for specific sites like facebook twitter and google plus
      there are specific options which let you block some plugins from some social media sites but not others

  if topic is 'http-on-examine-response'
    it sets up a response listener instead
